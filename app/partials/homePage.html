      <p>Hi! I am starting a new years resolution (obviously quite a late one) but recently I was placed in my local emergency department because I had been found in my boyfriends bathroom after self harming. I have had a 4 year history of self harm but this was the first time that I had been taken to the emergency department. I was not admitted instead we booked an appointment with my therapist and of me went. After that night I have decided that I want to actually start to like this body that I live in and create a new me! The only problem that I have with my physical body is my weight. Now a lot of my friends say oh but youre so skinny you dont need to lose weight but it will make me happy and I hope that they will support me through my journey to my new self!</p>
